# GifTastic


Overview:


.Using the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of 'Disney Movies'. 


.We call the GIPHY API using JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML.



.Like many APIs, GIPHY requires developers to use a key to access their API data. Their public API Key is provided here.




.This app takes the topics in our array of 'Dasney Movies' and creates buttons inHTML as well as it allows you to add you favorite disney movies as well.


.Used a loop that appends a button for each string in the array.


.When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.


.When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it will stop playing.


.Every gif, displays its rating (PG, G, so on).
